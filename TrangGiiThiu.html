            Outlook sources a wide range of product categories at all price
            points for the home furnishings, hospitality and multi-family
            construction industries from factories located throughout Asia. We
            maintain offices in Indonesia, China, Philippines, Vietnam and India
            as well as sourcing and quality control staff in Taiwan and
            Malaysia. We are ideally suited to take advantage of a wide range of
            raw materials, vendor capabilities, and price points to meet the
            requirements of our customers. Our founders and managers have
            backgrounds in furniture manufacturing, chemical coatings/finishing,
            quality control, and product testing. Every country has its own
            unique strengths and Outlookâ€™s presence and local expertise across
            Asia gives our customers access to the widest range of products and
            alternatives to provide the best produce choices as well as to help
            protect against potential high tariffs and anti-dumping situations
            in some countries.

          <p class="our-vendor-base">
            Our vendor base runs into the hundreds and are among the most
            capable, highest quality, and most successful manufacturers in Asia.
            We source products made of wood, metal, stone, concrete, as well as
            leather and textile upholstery products. Outlook has become an
            industry leader in sourcing products made with materials such as
            bamboo, rattan, shell, seagrass, and other natural substances. We
            have many vendors we have worked with since the company was founded.
            Many of our vendors have passed social compliance audits for those
            customers who require compliance certification. Most of our wood
            products vendors have access to sustainable raw materials with many
            using lumber certified by the Forest Stewardship Council. We believe
            in working with vendors who use sustainable and environmentally
            friendly raw materials.
