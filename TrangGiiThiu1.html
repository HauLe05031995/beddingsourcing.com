            We work closely with our customers from product inspiration to
            physical samples. We believe the first step towards achieving a
            quality product, begins during the product development stage. Our
            product engineers look for potential construction issues and work to
            make sure the products that are developed fit within the vendors’
            capabilities. The product development stage also allows our product
            development team to work closely with our customers’ designers and
            merchants to understand the key attributes and design features they
            are looking for in new products. Every customer is assigned a team
            of experienced product development staff including sample
            development coordinators, product engineers and finishing
            technicians who work closely with our customers, designers, and
            vendors to achieve high quality samples.
          </p>
          <p class="we-work-closely">
            Our product engineers work closely with our vendors and customers to
            “value engineer” products as needed to achieve our customers target
            price points. We develop and maintain detailed information on every
            item to ensure accurate reproduction as the products progress into
            manufacturing. Each product development team works under the
            direction of our account managers and country managers, all of whom
            have years of “hands-on” experience.
          </p>
          <p class="we-work-closely">
            We also have several designers on staff that allow us to offer
            limited design capabilities to our customers, primarily in retail
            furniture, which is especially useful for customers who rely on
            developing new products from products in the vendors showrooms.
          </p>
          <p class="outlook-also-has">
            Outlook also has a 5000 square feet showroom in our Vietnam office
            which our customers can use to review and develop new products. The
            showroom includes a color panel and textile library.
