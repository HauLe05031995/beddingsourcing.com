          <p class="outlooks-original-goal">
            Outlook’s original goal was not to find vendors who could build
            furniture like it was produced in the USA, but to build furniture in
            the Asian environment, often in very high humidity conditions, that
            would survive after they reached homes in the USA. This is
            especially challenging during the winters when the humidity in the
            consumers’ homes can reach very low levels. To this day Outlook’s
            quality management include careful moisture monitoring of wood
            products, including residential and hospitality furniture, but also
            products like kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities. While doing
            end-of-line quality audits for some types of products is acceptable,
            we know this is not sufficient to ensure quality for wood products
            like furniture. Outlook is one of the few quality management
            companies that is engaged in quality control processes during the
            entire manufacturing process for furniture and many other products,
            not relying only on finished goods quality audits.

            Outlook built the first dedicated home furnishings product testing
            laboratory in Asia in 2001 and has operated and managed dedicated
            home furnishings testing labs ever since. It is in our DNA. What
            Outlook learns in product testing is carried over into our
            customers’ products and they are used to help improve our vendors’
            manufacturing processes. Outlook’s partner company –

            Testing in Philippines is performed at a lab that Outlook formerly
            owned in Cebu. Together, Outlook’s testing services cover a wide
            range of products and testing protocols covering construction and
            physical properties, but also includes packaging tests to
            international standards to ensure products shipped via common
            carriers or delivery services like UPS or FedEx that is so common
            today in eCommerce, will survive the journey from the factory in
            Asia to the consumer’s home.
